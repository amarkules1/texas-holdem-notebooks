    "Seems straightforward at first. Say player 1 has a 50% win rate against one other player ($W_1 = 0.5, N = 1$). Then if there are 2 other players($W_1 = 0.5, N = 2$), the probability that player 1 beats them both is the probability that player 1 beats player 2 times the probability that player 1 beats player 3:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ W_2 = 0.5 ^ 2 = 0.25 $$\n",

    "On the other hand, if there are 3 players and they all have an equal chance of winning, then the probability that player 1 is the winner should be the same as the odds that player 2 is the winner, and the same probability that player 3 is the winner, so:\n",
    "\n",
